/**
 * The Contains operator returns true if the first operand contains the second.
 * 
 * There are two overloads of this operator: List, T : The type of T must be the
 * same as the element type of the list. Interval, T : The type of T must be the
 * same as the point type of the interval.
 * 
 * For the List, T overload, this operator returns true if the given element is
 * in the list.
 * 
 * For the Interval, T overload, this operator returns true if the given point
 * is greater than or equal to the beginning point of the interval, and less
 * than or equal to the ending point of the interval. For open interval
 * boundaries, exclusive comparison operators are used. For closed interval
 * boundaries, if the interval boundary is null, the result of the boundary
 * comparison is considered true.
 * 
 * If either argument is null, the result is null.
 *
