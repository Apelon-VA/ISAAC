/**
 * The ProperIncludes operator returns true if the first operand includes the
 * second, and is strictly larger.
 * 
 * There are two overloads of this operator: List, List : The element type of
 * both lists must be the same. Interval, Interval : The point type of both
 * intervals must be the same.
 * 
 * For the List, List overload, this operator returns true if the first list
 * includes every element of the second list, and first list is strictly larger.
 * 
 * For the Interval, Interval overload, this operator returns true if the first
 * interval includes the second interval, and the intervals are not equal.
 * 
 * This operator uses the semantics described in the Begin and End operators to
 * determine interval boundaries.
 * 
 * If either argument is null, the result is null.
 *
