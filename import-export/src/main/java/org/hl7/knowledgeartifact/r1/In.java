/**
 * The In operator tests for membership in an interval or list.
 * 			
 * There are two overloads of this operator:
 * 	T, List : The type of T must be the same as the element type of the list.
 * 	T, Interval : The type of T must be the same as the point type of the interval.
 * 	
 * For the T, List overload, this operator returns true if the given element is in the given list.
 * 
 * For the T, Interval overload, this operator returns true if the given point is greater than or equal to the beginning point of the interval, and less than or equal to the ending point of the interval. For open interval boundaries, exclusive comparison operators are used. For closed interval boundaries, if the interval boundary is null, the result of the boundary comparison is considered true.
 * 
 * If either argument is null, the result is null.
 *
