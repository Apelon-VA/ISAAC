/**
 * The Overlaps operator returns true if the first interval overlaps the second. In other words, if the ending point of the first interval is greater than or equal to the starting point of the second interval, and the starting point of the first interval is less than or equal to the ending point of the second interval.
 * 			
 * This operator uses the semantics described in the Begin and End operators to determine interval boundaries.
 * 
 * If either argument is null, the result is null.
