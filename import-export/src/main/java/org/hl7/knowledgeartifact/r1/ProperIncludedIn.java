/**
 * The ProperIncludedIn operator returns true if the first operand is included
 * in the second, and is strictly smaller.
 * 
 * There are two overloads of this operator: List, List : The element type of
 * both lists must be the same. Interval, Interval : The point type of both
 * intervals must be the same.
 * 
 * For the List, List overload, this operator returns true if every element of
 * the first list is included in the second list, and the first list is strictly
 * smaller.
 * 
 * For the Interval, Interval overload, this operator returns true if the first
 * interval is included in the second interval, and the intervals are not equal.
 * 
 * This operator uses the semantics described in the Begin and End operators to
 * determine interval boundaries.
 * 
 * If either argument is null, the result is null.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Java class for ProperIncludedIn complex type.
