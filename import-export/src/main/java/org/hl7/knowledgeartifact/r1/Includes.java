/**
 * The Includes operator returns true if the first operand completely includes
 * the second.
 * 
 * There are two overloads of this operator: List, List : The element type of
 * both lists must be the same. Interval, Interval : The point type of both
 * intervals must be the same.
 * 
 * For the List, List overload, this operator returns true if the first operand
 * includes every element of the second operand.
 * 
 * For the Interval, Interval overload, this operator returns true if beginning
 * point of the first interval is less than or equal to the beginning point of
 * the second interval, and the ending point of the first interval is greater
 * than or equal to the ending point of the second interval.
 * 
 * This operator uses the semantics described in the Begin and End operators to
 * determine interval boundaries.
 * 
 * If either argument is null, the result is null.
 *
