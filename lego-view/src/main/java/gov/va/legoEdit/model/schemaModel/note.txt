These classes are all generated from the schema via the command 

xjc -d ../java/ -xmlschema -p gov.va.legoEdit.model.schemaModel LEGO.xsd


Then, a second manual (yuck) step is done to annotate most of the classes as @Persistent - starting with Assertion.java and working down.
With the exception of MeasurementConstant (which doesn't need it because it is an enumeration) and the classes that correspond to the 
BDBModel (Lego, LegoList, Pncs, Stamp) as these classes are not stored in BDB.
