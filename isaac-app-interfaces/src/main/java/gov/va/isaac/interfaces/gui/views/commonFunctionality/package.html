		<p>
			The interfaces in this package represent the APIs that may or 
			MAY NOT exist on the classpath at runtime.  It is up to individual
			packagers of ISAAC to determine which functionality will be included
			in a bundle.  Any code that requests an instance of an implementation 
			of one of these common functionality packages should be prepared to get
			null - meaning that the function is not available in the bundle.
